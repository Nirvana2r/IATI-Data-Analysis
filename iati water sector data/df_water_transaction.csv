These provinces are among the poorest in the country\, with a high proportion of the population of 70% for both regions compared to the national average of 60%\, below the poverty line. This sub-programme\, while part of a process of ongoing consultation with the main donors of the water sector in the country\, constitutes the second phase of the Bank's AEPA Initiative in rural Niger. At the same time\, it is a full-fledged entity of the country's National Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation Programme for 2020 (PNAEPA). The main expected accomplishments of the subprogramme at the end of the 36-month period foreseen for its implementation are: (i) 9881 new individual latrines for the most vulnerable families; (ii) 9881 washing bins and hand-washing facilities; (iii) 295 new multi-compartment latrines\, built in village public infrastructure (schools\, health centres and other public places); (iv) 99 water supply structures and networks; (v) 297 new boreholes equipped with human-powered pumps; (vi) 130 boreholes equipped with human-powered pumps\, rehabilitated; (vii) 300 masons trained in latrine construction techniques; (viii) 300 female relays and 150 school teachers trained in hygiene and prevention at the village level; (ix) 99 associations of public water service users (AUSPE) and 427 water point management committees (CGPE) set up\, run and trained in the management and maintenance of water points; (x) some 30 private operators supported and trained in the operation and maintenance of complex AEP networks; (xi) 50 artisanal borehole repairers trained and equipped with recovery equipment through pumping equipment contracts; and (xii) training\, facilitation and awareness-raising campaigns carried out in nearly 526 localities in the two subprogramme regions. The estimated pre-tax cost of the subprogramme is UA 34.069 million.,Le présent sous-programme d’alimentation en eau potable et d’assainissement (AEPA) en milieu rural intervient dans l’ensemble des 11 départements des deux régions concernées (Tillabéry et Dosso). Ces provinces comptent parmi les plus pauvres du pays\, avec une forte proportion de la population 70% pour les deux régions contre 60% en moyenne nationale\, en dessous du seuil de pauvreté. Ce sous-programme\, tout en s’inscrivant dans une dynamique de concertation permanente avec les principaux bailleurs du secteur de l’eau dans le pays\, constitue la seconde phase de l’Initiative AEPA de la Banque en milieu rural au Niger. Dans le même temps\, il constitue une entité à part entière du Programme National d’Eau Potable et d’Assainissement en milieu rural du pays à l’horizon 2020 (PNAEPA). Les principales réalisations attendues du sous-programme au terme de la période de 36 mois prévue pour sa réalisation\, sont : (i) 9881 nouvelles latrines individuelles pour les familles les plus vulnérables; (ii) 9881 bacs à laver et dispositifs de lavemains ; (iii) 295 nouvelles latrines multi-compartiments\, construites au niveau des infrastructures publiques villageoises (écoles\, centres de santé et autres lieux publics); (iv) 99 ouvrages et réseaux d’AEP; (v) 297 nouveaux forages équipés de pompes à motricité humaine ; (vi) 130 forages équipés de pompes à motricité humaine\, réhabilités ; (vii) 300 maçons formés aux techniques de construction des latrines; (viii) 300 relais féminins et 150 maîtres d’écoles formés sur les thèmes de l’hygiène et de la prévention au niveau des villages; (ix) 99 associations des usagers du service public de l’eau (AUSPE) et 427 comités de gestion de points d’eau (CGPE) mis en place\, animés et formés à la gestion et à l’entretien des points d’eau; (x) une trentaine d’opérateurs privés appuyés et formés à l’exploitation et à la maintenance de réseaux d’AEP complexes; (xi) 50 artisans réparateurs de forages formés et dotés en matériel de dépannage par le biais des contrats d’équipements de pompage; et (xii) des campagnes de formation\, animation et sensibilisation réalisées dans près de 526 localités des deux régions du sous-programme. Le coût estimatif hors taxe du sous-programme est de 34\,069 millions d’UC.,Due to the nature of the works put in place\, the subprogramme will allow\, among other things: (i) improving the availability and quality of drinking water; (ii) reducing the difficulty of carrying water\, especially for women; (iii) reducing the cost of water; (iv) reducing the prevalence rate of waterborne diseases; and (v) promoting water-related income-generating activities. Indeed\, the community work approach recommended for the construction of family latrines will allow rural artisans to participate fully in the construction of the works.,De par la nature des ouvrages mis en place\, le sous-programme permettra entre autres : (i) l’amélioration de la disponibilité et de la qualité de l’eau de consommation; (ii) la réduction de la pénibilité du portage de l’eau\, notamment pour les femmes; (iii) la réduction du coût de l’eau; (iv) la réduction du taux de prévalence des maladies d’origine hydrique; et (v) la promotion des activités génératrices de revenus liées à l’eau.

Cela entraîne à son tour une plus grande autonomie et une augmentation des revenus.","Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands,Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands,Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands,GTZ",Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs,NE,14015,Water resources conservation (including data collection),Water resources conservation (including data collection),2,2020-11-11T00:00:00Z,4000000,EUR,,XM-DAC-7,Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands,2020,11,11

Especially since the surroundings of this River is where the population derives the bulk of its revenues from\, through fishing and the production of green pepper. Another source of income compromised is the border trade. People are no longer able to buy and sell their products on Nigeria’s market.\r\n\r\nCADEV-Niger\, faithful to its mission of supporting vulnerable populations has agreed on the need to demonstrate the Catholic Church’s solidarity to the displaced persons and the host populations.\r\n\r\nThis project introduced by Caritas Niger has dual objectives.

People with disabilities are particularly disadvantaged by the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and the measures taken to control the pandemic. \r\nThe risk of contracting COVID-19 is higher among people with disabilities and the risk of medical complications and death related to COVID-19 is higher among people with disabilities.\r\nWith an estimated population of 22.8 million\, Niger is one of the countries with one of the highest natural population growth rates in the world (3.9% per year)1 and the disabled population is estimated at 4.2% (2.11% women and 2.06% men) .\r\n\r\nThis project therefore aims to support people with disabilities to reduce the considerable economic and health impact that this pandemic has on their daily lives by providing them with food to meet their immediate needs but also by supporting their income-generating activities and ensuring the strengthening of their capacities or by accompanying them in learning the profession in order to strengthen their long-term resilience.\r\nThis project will support people with disabilities to become stakeholders in the prevention of Covid-19 by raising their awareness of the barriers against Covid-19\, by training and supporting women with disabilities in the sewing of masks in line with government recommendations. Hand washing kits adapted to people with disabilities as well as other pandemic prevention equipment and products will be distributed to the beneficiaries (disinfectant gels).","Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD),Caritas Developpement Niamey",CAFOD,NE,14030,Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation,,3,2021-03-17T00:00:00Z,41459,GBP,,,CAFOD General Funds,2021,3,17
2329,GB-CHC-285776-NIG122,CAFOD,Project to support Covid-19 prevention initiatives in Niger,"Being a deeply rural Sahelian country\, Niger records rainfall over a period of three months. This is the period when the majority of the population is active in agriculture. During the other nine months of the year\, it is traditional for people to migrate to neighbouring countries to work at small jobs in order to survive during the lean season. This phenomenon is amplified by the porosity of the borders. These uncontrolled movements of people (especially after the reopening of land borders borders in June 2021 for purely economic reasons after their closure at the beginning of the pandemic) are at the origin of several problems that the state has to face\, such as insecurity\, extremism\, human trafficking and the high risk of circulating diseases from one area to another\, especially Covid-19.\r\n\r\nConcerning the application of barrier measures\, internally\, it should be noted that the population has greatly lowered its guard and no longer scrupulously applies the barrier measures recommended by the Ministry of Health. This situation is relatively due to the lack of an adequate communication and the circulation of messages of disinformation.\r\n\r\nAs for vaccination\, it was launched on 29 March 2021 with AstraZeneca and Sinopharma vaccines. \r\nHowever\, in view of the results obtained\, only about 3.3% of the targeted population of 10\,318\,339 people have been vaccinated. Additional efforts are still required to reach the vaccination targets recommended to country\, namely 10% of the population vaccinated by September 2021 and 30% by December 2021.To reach this goal\, raising awareness among the population remains the key to success in a country where bad rumours are circulating to discourage the population from being vaccinated.\r\nThis project will therefore contribute to prevention through awareness raising activities on barrier measures and the usefulness of vaccination and distribution of Covid-19 prevention products and equipment in border regions which currently represent high risk areas after the reopening of land borders and may serve as entry points for several cases of different Covid-19 variants from different neighbouring countries.","Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD),Caritas Developpement Niger",CAFOD,NE,14030,Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation,,3,2021-10-20T00:00:00Z,40698,GBP,,,CAFOD General Funds,2021,10,20

The distribution between SMR\, their Swedish member organizations and the local partners changes somewhat for the period to which the supplementary application relates. Based on the total budget for the supplementary application 2018-2019\, the proportion staying with the Swedish member organizations increases from 13% to 19% and the proportion staying with the local partners decreases correspondingly from 81% to 75%.
