Out of the 4433 positive cases\, 3583 cases have been declared cured\, 153 people have died and 697 active cases are being treated.\r\nThis pandemic context aggravates an already unstable and poor health situation characterised by persistent seasonal epidemics (meningitis\, measles)\, a high mortality rate (Maternal mortality rate: 509 per 100\,000 live births\, Deaths under five: 85 per 1\,000 live births) against the backdrop of a very weak health system and factors that increase the vulnerability of the population or facilitate the spread of the virus (drought\, food insecurity\, transhumance\, difficulty of access to water).\r\nThe negative impact of this pandemic is not only health-related\, but also economic\, especially in a country where human development indicators are very low\, making Niger one of the poorest countries in the world\, chronically affecting more than a quarter of the population (26.8%). \r\nThis impact is much more pronounced among the disabled population than among the rest of the population. People with disabilities are particularly disadvantaged by the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and the measures taken to control the pandemic. \r\nThe risk of contracting COVID-19 is higher among people with disabilities and the risk of medical complications and death related to COVID-19 is higher among people with disabilities.\r\nWith an estimated population of 22.8 million\, Niger is one of the countries with one of the highest natural population growth rates in the world (3.9% per year)1 and the disabled population is estimated at 4.2% (2.11% women and 2.06% men) .\r\n\r\nThis project therefore aims to support people with disabilities to reduce the considerable economic and health impact that this pandemic has on their daily lives by providing them with food to meet their immediate needs but also by supporting their income-generating activities and ensuring the strengthening of their capacities or by accompanying them in learning the profession in order to strengthen their long-term resilience.\r\nThis project will support people with disabilities to become stakeholders in the prevention of Covid-19 by raising their awareness of the barriers against Covid-19\, by training and supporting women with disabilities in the sewing of masks in line with government recommendations.

1036,GB-CHC-285776-NIG122,CAFOD,Project to support Covid-19 prevention initiatives in Niger,"Being a deeply rural Sahelian country\, Niger records rainfall over a period of three months. This is the period when the majority of the population is active in agriculture. During the other nine months of the year\, it is traditional for people to migrate to neighbouring countries to work at small jobs in order to survive during the lean season. This phenomenon is amplified by the porosity of the borders. These uncontrolled movements of people (especially after the reopening of land borders borders in June 2021 for purely economic reasons after their closure at the beginning of the pandemic) are at the origin of several problems that the state has to face\, such as insecurity\, extremism\, human trafficking and the high risk of circulating diseases from one area to another\, especially Covid-19.\r\n\r\nConcerning the application of barrier measures\, internally\, it should be noted that the population has greatly lowered its guard and no longer scrupulously applies the barrier measures recommended by the Ministry of Health. This situation is relatively due to the lack of an adequate communication and the circulation of messages of disinformation.\r\n\r\nAs for vaccination\, it was launched on 29 March 2021 with AstraZeneca and Sinopharma vaccines. \r\nHowever\, in view of the results obtained\, only about 3.3% of the targeted population of 10\,318\,339 people have been vaccinated. Additional efforts are still required to reach the vaccination targets recommended to country\, namely 10% of the population vaccinated by September 2021 and 30% by December 2021.To reach this goal\, raising awareness among the population remains the key to success in a country where bad rumours are circulating to discourage the population from being vaccinated.\r\nThis project will therefore contribute to prevention through awareness raising activities on barrier measures and the usefulness of vaccination and distribution of Covid-19 prevention products and equipment in border regions which currently represent high risk areas after the reopening of land borders and may serve as entry points for several cases of different Covid-19 variants from different neighbouring countries.","Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD),Caritas Developpement Niger",CAFOD,NE,14030,Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation,,3,2021-10-20 00:00:00+00:00,40698,GBP,,,CAFOD General Funds,2021,10,20,0.822061,0.707271,0.530383,0.573665,0.766357,0.110487,0.973276,1.0,0.00617434

Istället har PMU\, som är en medlemsorganisation till SMR\, valt att söka bidrag för projekt till stöd för civila samhället i utvecklingsländer från SMR\, som vidareförmedlar bidrag från CSO-anslaget. SMR har redan inför det nuvarande underavtalet för perioden 2017-2021 fått erbjudandet av Sida att komplettera med en tilläggsansökan för perioden 2018-2019 som motsvarar SMR:s bedömning och rekommendationer om stöd till PMU. Därefter har PMU inkommit till SMR med en ansökan om bidrag från SMR för perioden 2018-2019. \r\n\r\nBUDGET\r\nSMR ansöker totalt om 122 000 000 SEK för tvåårsperioden 2018-2019\, utöver det redan avtalade beloppet om 790 000 000 SEK. Detta är samma belopp som PMU ansökt om till SMR. SMR:s totala budget för tilläggsansökan 2018-2019 är på 134 551 400 SEK (inklusive 12 551 400 SEK i egeninsats). Fördelningen mellan SMR\, deras svenska medlemsorganisationer och de lokala samarbetspartnerna förändras något för den perioden som tilläggsansökan avser. Med utgångspunkt i den totala budgeten för tilläggsansökan 2018-2019 ökar andelen som stannar hos de svenska medlemsorganisationerna från 13 % till 19 % och andelen som stannar hos de lokala samarbetspartnerna minskar motsvarande från 81 % till 75 %. Fortsatt stannar omkring 6 % hos SMR.  \r\n\r\nGRUND FÖR SIDAS BEDÖMNING\r\nBeredningen har till störst del grundat sig på SMR:s insatsbedömning av PMU:s programansökan\, men även SMR:s organisationsbedömning av PMU och Sidas uppföljning av SMR och PMU i Kenya\, maj 2017. Sida har även haft tillgång till PMU:s programansökan till SMR\, samt PMU:s respons på SMR:s kompletterande frågor gällande ansökan. \r\n\r\nBEREDNINGEN\r\nEftersom insatsen bereds som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut har beredningen i så stor utsträckning som möjligt utgått från den omfattande beredning som gjordes av ansökan för den pågående avtalsperioden 2017-2021. Då bedömningen som gjordes av ansökan 2017-2021 fortsatt är relevant har denna behållits och kompletterande kommentarer gällande 2018-2019 har lagts till där tilläggsansökan föranleder en uppdaterad kompletterande bedömning. De revideringar som gjorts av beredningen berör därför endast perioden 2018-2019.,Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19\rReprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\rSMR has submitted an additional application for Sida grants for 2018-2019 in total\n122\,000\,000 SEK.\n\nADDITIONAL APPLICATION\nPrior to this agreement period\, the Pentecostal Mission's development cooperation (PMU) has not been given renewed status as a framework organization at Sida and thus no longer receives direct support from the CSO grant. Instead\, PMU\, which is a member organization of SMR\, has chosen to apply for grants for projects in support of civil society in developing countries from SMR\, which pass on grants from the CSO grant. Prior to the current sub-agreement for the period 2017-2021\, SMR has already received an offer from Sida to supplement it with an additional application for the period 2018-2019\, which corresponds to SMR's assessment and recommendations for support to PMU. Subsequently\, PMU has submitted to SMR with an application for a grant from SMR for the period 2018-2019.\n\nBUDGET\nSMR is applying for a total of SEK 122\,000\,000 for the two-year period 2018-2019\, in addition to the already agreed amount of SEK 790\,000\,000. This is the same amount that the PMU applied for to SMR. SMR's total budget for the supplementary application 2018-2019 is SEK 134\,551\,400 (including SEK 12\,551\,400 in own contribution). The distribution between SMR\, their Swedish member organizations and the local partners changes somewhat for the period to which the supplementary application relates. Based on the total budget for the supplementary application 2018-2019\, the proportion staying with the Swedish member organizations increases from 13% to 19% and the proportion staying with the local partners decreases correspondingly from 81% to 75%. About 6% still stay with SMR.\n\nBASIS FOR PAGE ASSESSMENT\nThe preparation has largely been based on SMR's input assessment of PMU's program application\, but also SMR's organizational assessment of PMU and Sida's follow-up of SMR and PMU in Kenya\, May 2017. Sida has also had access to PMU's program application to SMR\, and the PMU's response to SMR's supplementary questions regarding the application.\n\nTHE PREPARATION\nSince the intervention is prepared as a supplementary intervention decision\, the preparation has\, as far as possible\, been based on the extensive preparation made of the application for the ongoing agreement period 2017-2021. As the assessment made of the application 2017-2021 is still relevant\, this has been retained and supplementary comments regarding 2018-2019 have been added where the additional application causes an updated supplementary assessment. The revisions made by the committee therefore only affect the period 2018-2019.,Övergripande mål för SMR:s verksamhetsområde 'Långsiktigt utvecklingssamarbete' (som styr merparten av Sida-finansierade verksamheten):\n\n""Att bidra till utvecklingen av ett hållbart\, rättvist\, fredligt\, jämställt och demokratiskt samhälle i samarbetsländerna\, där de mänskliga rättigheterna respekteras\, skyddas och uppfylls\, genom stöd och kapacitetsutveckling till förändringsaktörer med legitimitet och förmåga att arbeta rättighetsbaserat för att utkräva ansvar av skyldighetsbärare och att stärka rättighetsinnehavares organisering\, egenmakt och förutsättningar att själva förändra sina livsvillkor.""","Sweden,SMR/Svenska Missionsrådet,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,SMR/Svenska Missionsrådet",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,NE,14030,Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation,"Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation,Water Supply & Sanitation",2,2017-01-01 00:00:00+00:00,318558,USD,,,,2017,1,1,0.8308455564245815,0.6967457141268071,0.5439101540229887,0.5664920765606598,0.7180685238636358,0.1111076644414169,1.012116487612611,1.0,0.006496077192982453

SMR har redan inför det nuvarande underavtalet för perioden 2017-2021 fått erbjudandet av Sida att komplettera med en tilläggsansökan för perioden 2018-2019 som motsvarar SMR:s bedömning och rekommendationer om stöd till PMU. Därefter har PMU inkommit till SMR med en ansökan om bidrag från SMR för perioden 2018-2019. \r\n\r\nBUDGET\r\nSMR ansöker totalt om 122 000 000 SEK för tvåårsperioden 2018-2019\, utöver det redan avtalade beloppet om 790 000 000 SEK. Detta är samma belopp som PMU ansökt om till SMR. SMR:s totala budget för tilläggsansökan 2018-2019 är på 134 551 400 SEK (inklusive 12 551 400 SEK i egeninsats). Fördelningen mellan SMR\, deras svenska medlemsorganisationer och de lokala samarbetspartnerna förändras något för den perioden som tilläggsansökan avser. Med utgångspunkt i den totala budgeten för tilläggsansökan 2018-2019 ökar andelen som stannar hos de svenska medlemsorganisationerna från 13 % till 19 % och andelen som stannar hos de lokala samarbetspartnerna minskar motsvarande från 81 % till 75 %. Fortsatt stannar omkring 6 % hos SMR.  \r\n\r\nGRUND FÖR SIDAS BEDÖMNING\r\nBeredningen har till störst del grundat sig på SMR:s insatsbedömning av PMU:s programansökan\, men även SMR:s organisationsbedömning av PMU och Sidas uppföljning av SMR och PMU i Kenya\, maj 2017. Sida har även haft tillgång till PMU:s programansökan till SMR\, samt PMU:s respons på SMR:s kompletterande frågor gällande ansökan. \r\n\r\nBEREDNINGEN\r\nEftersom insatsen bereds som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut har beredningen i så stor utsträckning som möjligt utgått från den omfattande beredning som gjordes av ansökan för den pågående avtalsperioden 2017-2021. Då bedömningen som gjordes av ansökan 2017-2021 fortsatt är relevant har denna behållits och kompletterande kommentarer gällande 2018-2019 har lagts till där tilläggsansökan föranleder en uppdaterad kompletterande bedömning.

Instead\, PMU\, which is a member organization of SMR\, has chosen to apply for grants for projects in support of civil society in developing countries from SMR\, which pass on grants from the CSO grant. Prior to the current sub-agreement for the period 2017-2021\, SMR has already received an offer from Sida to supplement it with an additional application for the period 2018-2019\, which corresponds to SMR's assessment and recommendations for support to PMU. Subsequently\, PMU has submitted to SMR with an application for a grant from SMR for the period 2018-2019.\n\nBUDGET\nSMR is applying for a total of SEK 122\,000\,000 for the two-year period 2018-2019\, in addition to the already agreed amount of SEK 790\,000\,000. This is the same amount that the PMU applied for to SMR. SMR's total budget for the supplementary application 2018-2019 is SEK 134\,551\,400 (including SEK 12\,551\,400 in own contribution). The distribution between SMR\, their Swedish member organizations and the local partners changes somewhat for the period to which the supplementary application relates. Based on the total budget for the supplementary application 2018-2019\, the proportion staying with the Swedish member organizations increases from 13% to 19% and the proportion staying with the local partners decreases correspondingly from 81% to 75%. About 6% still stay with SMR.\n\nBASIS FOR PAGE ASSESSMENT\nThe preparation has largely been based on SMR's input assessment of PMU's program application\, but also SMR's organizational assessment of PMU and Sida's follow-up of SMR and PMU in Kenya\, May 2017. Sida has also had access to PMU's program application to SMR\, and the PMU's response to SMR's supplementary questions regarding the application.\n\nTHE PREPARATION\nSince the intervention is prepared as a supplementary intervention decision\, the preparation has\, as far as possible\, been based on the extensive preparation made of the application for the ongoing agreement period 2017-2021. As the assessment made of the application 2017-2021 is still relevant\, this has been retained and supplementary comments regarding 2018-2019 have been added where the additional application causes an updated supplementary assessment.
